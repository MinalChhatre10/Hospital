            Jehangir Hospital was established in 1946. It began as Jehangir Nursing Home when its founders, Sir Cowasji Jehangir and Lady Hirabai Jehangir, invited the eminent Dr. Edul jee H. Coyaji to set up a facility to offer personalized care of high quality at an affordable price to the people of Poona. On the 6th of February, 1946, it became the city's first significant private hospital with only a few beds.
         </p>
         <p>
            In 1998, Jehangir Hospital was equipped with 350 beds, tied up with the Apollo Hospitals Group to help manage and modernize the hospital. The Jehangir Hospital - Apollo Hospitals Group synergy provided the best outcome for the patients: superior technology and medical skill combined with quality patient care
